# Spec: pos-api

## Purpose

Define the Point-of-Sale (POS) API: atomic sale emission, cancellation, editing, and listing under `/api/v1/admin/sales`. Includes the `SaleTotalsCalculator` domain service and branch scoping rules for all sale endpoints.

---
## Requirements
### Requirement: Sale aggregate model
The system SHALL persist a sale as the aggregate `Sale` (header) + `SaleItem` (lines) with the following invariants:

- `Sale.status` is one of `completed`, `cancelled`, `edited`. There is no `open`/`draft` state — the cart lives in the client.
- `Sale.paymentStatus` is one of `paid`, `partial`, `pending`. Computed and persisted at every mutation that affects `paidAmount`:
  - `paid` when `paidAmount >= total`.
  - `partial` when `0 < paidAmount < total`.
  - `pending` when `paidAmount === 0`.
  - For sales whose `paymentMethod.isCredit === false`, `paymentStatus` is ALWAYS `paid` from emission (no `CustomerPayment` rows ever attach to them — they're paid at the moment).
  - For sales whose `paymentMethod.isCredit === true`, `paymentStatus` starts at `pending` and progresses to `partial` and then `paid` as `CustomerPayment` rows accumulate.
- `Sale.paidAmount` is `Decimal(14,4) DEFAULT 0`. Updated atomically by `RegisterPaymentUseCase` and `CancelPaymentUseCase` of the `payments` module (and on cancellation/edit of the sale when no active payments exist).
- The "credit nature" of a sale is NOT a field on `Sale`; it is inferred from `Sale.paymentMethod.isCredit` via JOIN (or `include`). The application MAY expose a derived `isCredit: boolean` in DTOs at read time but SHALL NOT persist it as a column on `sales`. Consumers SHOULD treat `paymentMethod.isCredit` as the source of truth.
- `Sale` references `branchId`, `customerId`, `cashierId` (the authenticated user who emitted the sale), `paymentMethodId`, `folioId`. All FKs `ON DELETE RESTRICT` (cancelling these catalog rows requires reassigning or archiving sales first).
- `Sale.folioNumber` is an integer assigned atomically at emission; `(folioId, folioNumber)` is UNIQUE.
- `Sale.folioCode` is a snapshot of the folio's `code` (and `prefix` when present, concatenated as `"${prefix}${number}"` or `"${code}-${number}"` per implementation choice — documented in `pos-api`).
- `Sale.subtotal`, `Sale.taxTotal`, `Sale.total` are persisted (computed at emission).
- `Sale.quoteId` is a nullable reference to a `Quote` (FK `ON DELETE SET NULL`). Indexed via `sales(quote_id)`. When the sale was emitted directly via `POST /api/v1/admin/sales` without a quote, the column is `null`. When the sale was emitted via `POST /api/v1/admin/quotes/:id/convert`, the column points to the originating quote.
- Each `SaleItem` snapshots `productCodeSnapshot`, `productNameSnapshot`, `priceNameSnapshot`, `unitPrice`, `discountPct`, `ivaRate`, `iepsRate` so the ticket survives later changes to the catalog. `productId` (FK `ON DELETE RESTRICT`) and `productPriceId` (FK `ON DELETE SET NULL`) are retained for reporting.
- Each `SaleItem` persists `lineSubtotal`, `lineTax`, `lineTotal`.
- **Dosification lines**: a `SaleItem` MAY originate from a `ProductDosification` instead of a `ProductPrice`. In that case `productPriceId` SHALL be `null`, and the line additionally persists `dosificationId` (nullable FK to `product_dosifications`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`) and `numPartsSnapshot` (nullable `INT`, the dosification's `numParts` at the time of sale). `priceNameSnapshot` SHALL hold the dosification's `name` for these lines (same column, same display purpose as for price-based lines). Exactly one of `productPriceId`/`dosificationId` SHALL be non-null per `SaleItem` — never both, never neither. `unitPrice` for a dosification line is `DosificationPriceCalculator.computeUnitPrice(defaultPrice.price, numParts, surchargePct)`, where `surchargePct` is the value currently configured via `settings-api` (`GET /settings/pricing` → `dosificationSurchargePct`, default `5.0`) — NOT a fixed constant. `quantity` for a dosification line represents the number of dosification parts sold and MAY exceed `numParts` (selling more than one full container in a single line is allowed, e.g. 6 parts of a `numParts=4` dosification).
- **Inventory quantity for dosification lines**: any operation that moves `branch_inventory.quantity` from a `SaleItem` (creation, cancellation, edit) SHALL use `quantity / numPartsSnapshot` as the base-unit amount when `numPartsSnapshot` is non-null, instead of `quantity` directly. For lines without a dosification (`numPartsSnapshot = null`), the amount is `quantity` unchanged (no behavior change).

#### Scenario: Snapshot survives product rename
- **WHEN** a sale is completed for product `ARROZ_001 ("Arroz 1kg")`, and later the product is renamed to `"Arroz Integral 1kg"`
- **THEN** `GET /api/v1/admin/sales/:id` for the prior sale still returns `productNameSnapshot: "Arroz 1kg"` on that line

#### Scenario: Snapshot survives price deletion
- **WHEN** a sale is completed using `productPriceId = X`, and later the price `X` is hard-deleted via `DELETE /products/:id/prices/:priceId`
- **THEN** `GET /api/v1/admin/sales/:id` still returns the persisted `unitPrice`, `discountPct`, and `priceNameSnapshot` from when the sale was emitted, with `productPriceId: null` in the response

#### Scenario: Quote link exposed in detail
- **WHEN** a sale was emitted via `POST /api/v1/admin/quotes/:id/convert` from a quote whose id is `Q`
- **THEN** `GET /api/v1/admin/sales/:saleId` returns `quoteId: "Q"` in the `SaleDetailDto`

#### Scenario: Direct sale has null quote link
- **WHEN** a sale was emitted via `POST /api/v1/admin/sales` without a `quoteId` in the body
- **THEN** `GET /api/v1/admin/sales/:saleId` returns `quoteId: null`

#### Scenario: Deleting the originating quote does not break the sale
- **WHEN** a sale has `quoteId = Q` and the row in `quotes` with id `Q` is removed (manually or via a future purge module)
- **THEN** the sale row is preserved; `sale.quoteId` becomes `null` via the FK's `ON DELETE SET NULL`

#### Scenario: Cash sale has paymentStatus paid immediately
- **WHEN** a sale is emitted with a `paymentMethod` whose `isCredit=false` and `total=1000`
- **THEN** the persisted row has `paid_amount=1000`, `payment_status='paid'`

#### Scenario: Credit sale starts pending
- **WHEN** a sale is emitted with a `paymentMethod` whose `isCredit=true` and `total=1000`
- **THEN** the persisted row has `paid_amount=0`, `payment_status='pending'`

#### Scenario: SaleDetailDto exposes isCredit as derived field
- **WHEN** an authorized caller fetches `GET /api/v1/admin/sales/:id` for a sale whose `paymentMethod.isCredit=true`
- **THEN** the response includes `isCredit: true` derived from the JOIN; the field is read-only and not persisted on the `sales` table

#### Scenario: Dosification line snapshots numParts and dosificationId
- **WHEN** a sale is emitted with a line whose `dosificationId` references a dosification with `numParts=4`
- **THEN** the persisted `sale_items` row has `productPriceId: null`, `dosificationId` set, `numPartsSnapshot=4`, and `priceNameSnapshot` equal to the dosification's `name`

#### Scenario: Dosification quantity may exceed numParts
- **WHEN** a sale line sells `quantity=6` parts of a dosification with `numParts=4`
- **THEN** the line is accepted (no upper bound on `quantity` relative to `numParts`); `lineTotal = 6 * computedUnitPrice`

---

### Requirement: List sales
The system SHALL expose `GET /api/v1/admin/sales` that returns a paginated list of sales. Requires the `sales:read` permission. Query parameters: `page` (default 1), `pageSize` (default 20, max 100), `branchId` (optional UUID), `customerId` (optional UUID), `status` (optional, comma-separated; one or more of `completed`,`cancelled`,`edited`), `from` (optional ISO date — inclusive lower bound on `created_at`), `to` (optional ISO date — inclusive upper bound on `created_at`), `search` (optional, min 2 chars; matches `folio_code`, `folio_number::text`, or joined `customer.name`/`customer.rfc`).

Each `SaleDto` includes `id`, `folioId`, `folioCode`, `folioNumber`, `branchId`, `branchName` (joined), `customerId`, `customerName` (joined), `customerRfc` (joined), `cashierId`, `cashierName` (joined), `paymentMethodId`, `paymentMethodCode` (joined), `isCredit` (derived from `paymentMethod.isCredit`), `quoteId` (string or `null`), `status`, `paidAmount` (string, 4 decimals), `paymentStatus` (one of `paid`, `partial`, `pending`), `subtotal`, `taxTotal`, `total`, `notes`, `completedAt`, `cancelledAt`, `cancellationReason`, `editedAt`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. `items` is NOT included in the list response.

Sorted by `created_at DESC`.

**Branch scoping**: if the caller does NOT have `branches:access_all`, the system SHALL behave as follows:

- If `?branchId=` is absent → the system implicitly applies `branchId = x-user-branch-id`. If `x-user-branch-id` is empty (user has no assigned branch), the system returns HTTP 403 `{"error": "Forbidden", "required": "branches:access_all"}`.
- If `?branchId=<X>` is present and `X !== x-user-branch-id` → HTTP 403.

If the caller HAS `branches:access_all`:

- If `?branchId=` is absent → returns sales across all branches.
- If `?branchId=<X>` is present → filters to that branch.

#### Scenario: Operator lists own branch
- **WHEN** an `operator` with `x-user-branch-id: B1` (no `branches:access_all`) calls `GET /api/v1/admin/sales`
- **THEN** the system implicitly filters to `branchId = B1` and returns HTTP 200, including `quoteId` for each row (or `null` if the sale was direct)

#### Scenario: Operator tries another branch
- **WHEN** an `operator` with `x-user-branch-id: B1` calls `GET /api/v1/admin/sales?branchId=B2`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403 `{"error": "Forbidden", "required": "branches:access_all"}`

#### Scenario: Admin lists all branches
- **WHEN** an `admin` (has `branches:access_all`) calls `GET /api/v1/admin/sales`
- **THEN** the system returns sales from all branches

#### Scenario: Operator without branch tries to list
- **WHEN** an `operator` with `x-user-branch-id: ""` (no branch assigned) calls `GET /api/v1/admin/sales` without `?branchId=`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403

#### Scenario: Filter by date range
- **WHEN** the request includes `?from=2026-01-01&to=2026-01-31`
- **THEN** only sales with `created_at` within that range are returned

#### Scenario: Filter by multiple statuses
- **WHEN** the request includes `?status=completed,edited`
- **THEN** the response excludes sales whose status is `cancelled`

#### Scenario: Search by folio number
- **WHEN** the request includes `?search=1024`
- **THEN** sales whose `folio_number = 1024` OR whose `folio_code` contains "1024" are included

---

### Requirement: Get sale detail
The system SHALL expose `GET /api/v1/admin/sales/:id` that returns a single sale with its items. Requires `sales:read`. Returns HTTP 404 if not found. Branch scoping applies (a caller without `branches:access_all` can only fetch sales whose `branchId === x-user-branch-id`; otherwise HTTP 403).

`SaleDetailDto` extends `SaleDto` with:

- `items: SaleItemDto[]`, each including `id`, `productId`, `productPriceId` (or `null`), `productCodeSnapshot`, `productNameSnapshot`, `priceNameSnapshot`, `quantity`, `unitPrice`, `discountPct`, `ivaRate`, `iepsRate`, `lineSubtotal`, `lineTax`, `lineTotal`.
- `quoteId: string | null` (unchanged from `add-quotes-crud`).
- `returnedQuantityBySaleItem: Record<string, number>` — a map keyed by `sale_item.id` whose value is the SUM of `return_items.quantity` across all returns linked to this sale where `returns.status='completed'`. Keys for `sale_items` with no completed returns are OMITTED (consumers SHALL interpret "absent key" as `0`). Cancelled returns do NOT contribute to this aggregate.

#### Scenario: Authorized fetch
- **WHEN** a caller with `sales:read` and access to the sale's branch fetches a valid `:id`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 200 with the `SaleDetailDto` (including `quoteId` and `returnedQuantityBySaleItem`)

#### Scenario: Out-of-branch fetch
- **WHEN** a caller without `branches:access_all` fetches a sale whose `branchId !== x-user-branch-id`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403

#### Scenario: Sale not found
- **WHEN** the `:id` does not match any sale
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404 `{"error": "Sale not found"}`

#### Scenario: No returns on any line
- **WHEN** the sale has no `returns` rows (or only cancelled ones)
- **THEN** `returnedQuantityBySaleItem` is `{}` (empty record)

#### Scenario: Partial returns reported
- **WHEN** the sale has 3 items A, B, C and one `completed` return that returned 2 of A and 1 of C
- **THEN** `returnedQuantityBySaleItem` is `{ "<itemAId>": 2, "<itemCId>": 1 }` — B is absent (zero)

#### Scenario: Multiple completed returns aggregate per line
- **WHEN** the sale has item A returned twice (3 then 2, both completed)
- **THEN** `returnedQuantityBySaleItem["<itemAId>"] === 5`

#### Scenario: Cancelled return excluded from aggregate
- **WHEN** the sale has item A returned (4, status `completed`) and then that return is cancelled
- **THEN** `returnedQuantityBySaleItem["<itemAId>"]` is absent (cancelled returns contribute zero)

#### Scenario: Aggregate query is not paginated
- **WHEN** the sale has 50 returns across many lines (unusual but legal)
- **THEN** the aggregate still reflects the total per line; the query is a single `SUM`-grouped read against `return_items` joined to `returns`

---

### Requirement: Create sale (atomic emission)
The system SHALL expose `POST /api/v1/admin/sales` that emits a completed sale in a single transaction. Requires `sales:create`. Required body:

- `branchId: string` (UUID of an active branch)
- `customerId: string` (UUID of an active customer)
- `paymentMethodId: string` (UUID of an active payment method)
- `folioId: string` (UUID of an active folio)
- `items: SaleItemInput[]` (at least 1 item)

Each `SaleItemInput`:

- `productId: string` (UUID of an active product)
- `productPriceId: string` (UUID of a price belonging to `productId`) **OR** `dosificationId: string` (UUID of a dosification belonging to `productId`) — exactly one of the two SHALL be present; both present or both absent → HTTP 400.
- `quantity: number` (decimal `> 0`; max 14 integer + 4 decimal digits). For a dosification line, `quantity` is the number of parts sold (MAY exceed the dosification's `numParts`).

Optional body:

- `notes: string | null` (max 1000 chars)
- `quoteId: string | null` (UUID of an authorized, not-yet-converted quote; defaults to `null`)

The body MUST NOT include any explicit `isCredit` flag; the credit flow is activated automatically when the selected `paymentMethod` has `isCredit=true` (see "Credit flow auto-activation" below).

**Branch scoping**: callers without `branches:access_all` MUST pass `branchId === x-user-branch-id`; mismatch returns HTTP 403. Callers without an assigned branch (`x-user-branch-id` empty) and without `branches:access_all` return HTTP 403.

**Credit flow auto-activation (non-blocking)**: after loading the `paymentMethod`, if `paymentMethod.isCredit === true`, the controller SHALL:

1. Verify the caller has `sales:create_credit`; otherwise HTTP 403 `{"error":"Forbidden","required":"sales:create_credit"}`.
2. The system SHALL NOT reject the sale for lacking a credit line or for exceeding `creditLimit`. Instead, once the final total is known, it computes an informational flag: `creditLimitExceeded = customer.creditLimit !== null && (customer.currentBalance + sale.total) > customer.creditLimit`. When `customer.creditLimit === null` (no credit line configured), `creditLimitExceeded` is `false` — there is no limit to exceed.

This computation runs AFTER total calculation but BEFORE folio allocation, all within the same transaction; it never aborts the transaction.

**`quoteId` validation when present**: if the body includes a non-null `quoteId`, the controller SHALL:

1. Load the quote; if it does not exist → HTTP 400 `{"error": "Quote not found", "reason": "not_found"}`.
2. Verify `quote.status === 'authorized'` AND `quote.convertedSaleId === null`. If not → HTTP 400 `{"error": "Quote cannot be linked to a new sale (status=<actual>)", "reason": "wrong_status"}`.
3. Verify `quote.branchId === branchId` and `quote.customerId === customerId` (the sale's branch/customer must match the quote's; mismatch → HTTP 400 `{"error": "...", "reason": "branch_mismatch" | "customer_mismatch"}`). The quote does NOT constrain `paymentMethodId`, `folioId`, or `items` — those are governed by the sale body.
4. Persist `sale.quoteId = quoteId`; ALSO update the quote in the same transaction: `quote.status='converted'`, `quote.convertedAt=NOW()`, `quote.convertedSaleId=<newSaleId>` (this keeps both sides consistent regardless of whether the caller used `POST /sales` or `POST /quotes/:id/convert`).

The `quoteId` does NOT constrain whether the sale is cash or credit — the `paymentMethodId` of the body decides.

**Atomic flow (inside a Prisma transaction)**:

1. Validate `customer.isActive`, `branch.isActive`, `paymentMethod.isActive`, `folio.isActive`. Any inactive → HTTP 400.
2. Load `paymentMethod.isCredit` (via `include` or join) so the downstream branching is consistent within the transaction.
3. If `quoteId` is non-null: validate per the rules above; failure → HTTP 400.
4. For each item:
   - If `productPriceId` is present: load the `Product` and `ProductPrice`; verify `productPrice.productId === item.productId` (else `ProductPriceMismatchError` → HTTP 400) and belongs to a product whose `isActive = true` (else HTTP 400).
   - If `dosificationId` is present instead: load the `Product` and `ProductDosification`; verify `dosification.productId === item.productId` (else HTTP 400) and `dosification.isActive = true` (else HTTP 400); load the product's default `ProductPrice` — if none exists → HTTP 400 `{"error": "Dosification requires a default price"}`; resolve the currently configured `dosificationSurchargePct` from `settings-api` (default `5.0` when unconfigured); compute `unitPrice = DosificationPriceCalculator.computeUnitPrice(defaultPrice.price, dosification.numParts, surchargePct)`.
   - `quantity > 0` (else HTTP 400) for either case. The system MAY skip enforcement of `minQuantity` in v1 (documented, applies only to price-based lines).
5. Snapshot `productCodeSnapshot = product.code`, `productNameSnapshot = product.name`; for price-based lines: `priceNameSnapshot = price.name`, `unitPrice = price.price`, `discountPct = price.discountPct`; for dosification lines: `priceNameSnapshot = dosification.name`, `unitPrice` per above, `discountPct = null`, `dosificationId = dosification.id`, `numPartsSnapshot = dosification.numParts`. Both kinds set `ivaRate = product.ivaRate`, `iepsRate = product.iepsRate`.
6. Compute totals using `SaleTotalsCalculator` (domain service) — unchanged by dosification lines (operates on `quantity * unitPrice`, agnostic to what `quantity` represents).
7. If `paymentMethod.isCredit === true`: compute the informational `creditLimitExceeded` flag per "Credit flow auto-activation" above. This step never aborts the transaction.
8. Allocate the next folio number atomically: `UPDATE folios SET current_number = current_number + 1 WHERE id = ? AND is_active = true RETURNING current_number, code, prefix`. If `RETURNING` is empty (folio inactive) → HTTP 400.
9. For each item, decrement inventory using the base-unit amount (`quantity / numPartsSnapshot` for dosification lines, `quantity` otherwise — see "Sale aggregate model"): `UPDATE branch_inventory SET quantity = quantity - ${amount}, updated_at = NOW() WHERE branch_id = ? AND product_id = ?`. If the update affects 0 rows (no inventory record exists for this pair), the system SHALL `INSERT INTO branch_inventory (branch_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES (?, ?, -${amount})` (creates the record with negative initial quantity). The result `quantity` MAY be negative — this is the implementation of the rule "selling with stock 0 leaves negative quantity awaiting transfer". **After each such decrement**, the system SHALL evaluate the low-stock notification trigger per `admin-notifications-api` "Notify admin on low stock" (best-effort, never blocks or fails this endpoint).
10. Compute `paidAmount` and `paymentStatus`:
    - If `paymentMethod.isCredit === false`: `paidAmount = total`, `paymentStatus = 'paid'`.
    - If `paymentMethod.isCredit === true`: `paidAmount = 0`, `paymentStatus = 'pending'` (regardless of `creditLimitExceeded`).
11. `INSERT` the `sales` row with `status='completed'`, `completedAt=NOW()`, snapshotted folio info, `quote_id = quoteId` (or `null`), `paid_amount`, `payment_status`.
12. `INSERT` the `sale_items` rows.
13. If `paymentMethod.isCredit === true`: `UPDATE customers SET current_balance = current_balance + ? WHERE id = ?` (sale.customerId) — regardless of `creditLimitExceeded`.
14. If `quoteId` non-null: `UPDATE quotes SET status='converted', converted_at=NOW(), converted_sale_id=<newSaleId> WHERE id = quoteId`.

Returns HTTP 201 with the `SaleDetailDto` (including items, `quoteId`, `paidAmount`, `paymentStatus`, the derived `isCredit` from the JOIN, and `creditLimitExceeded: boolean` — always `false` for non-credit sales).

**BREAKING**: this endpoint no longer returns HTTP 409 for `CreditLimitExceededError` or `CustomerHasNoCreditLineError`. Callers that previously branched on those 409 responses MUST instead read `creditLimitExceeded` from the HTTP 201 body.

#### Scenario: Successful cash sale
- **WHEN** an `operator` with `x-user-branch-id: B1` and `sales:create` sends a valid body for branch B1 with 2 items, selecting a `paymentMethod` whose `isCredit=false` (no `quoteId`)
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 201 with the `SaleDetailDto` (`quoteId: null`, `isCredit: false`, `paidAmount: total`, `paymentStatus: 'paid'`, `creditLimitExceeded: false`), `branch_inventory.quantity` decremented by each item's quantity, and `folios.current_number` incremented by 1
- **AND** `customer.currentBalance` is NOT modified

#### Scenario: Successful credit sale via CREDITO payment method
- **WHEN** an `operator` with `sales:create` and `sales:create_credit` sends a body selecting the `paymentMethod` whose `code='CREDITO'` and `isCredit=true` for a customer with `creditLimit=10000`, `currentBalance=2000`, and the new sale `total=5000`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 201 with `paidAmount=0`, `paymentStatus='pending'`, `isCredit=true` (derived), `creditLimitExceeded=false` (7000 ≤ 10000); `customer.currentBalance` becomes `7000` after the transaction commits

#### Scenario: Credit payment method selected without sales:create_credit
- **WHEN** a caller with `sales:create` (but NOT `sales:create_credit`) selects a `paymentMethod` whose `isCredit=true`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403 `{"error":"Forbidden","required":"sales:create_credit"}`

#### Scenario: Credit sale exceeds creditLimit — sale still completes with warning flag
- **WHEN** the body selects a `paymentMethod` with `isCredit=true` for a customer with `creditLimit=10000`, `currentBalance=8000`, and `sale.total=5000`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 201 (NOT 409) with `creditLimitExceeded=true`, `paidAmount=0`, `paymentStatus='pending'`; the sale, sale items, folio increment, and inventory decrement are all persisted; `customer.currentBalance` becomes `13000`

#### Scenario: Credit sale for customer without credit line — sale still completes
- **WHEN** the body selects a `paymentMethod` with `isCredit=true` for a customer with `creditLimit=null`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 201 (NOT 409) with `creditLimitExceeded=false` (no limit configured, so nothing to exceed); the sale is persisted normally with `paidAmount=0`, `paymentStatus='pending'`

#### Scenario: Successful sale with quoteId (cash)
- **WHEN** the body includes `quoteId: Q` and a `paymentMethod` whose `isCredit=false`, where `Q` is an authorized quote with `convertedSaleId: null` and matching `branchId`/`customerId`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 201 with `quoteId: Q`, `isCredit=false`, `paidAmount=total`, `paymentStatus='paid'`; and the quote row has `status='converted'`, `convertedSaleId=<newSaleId>`

#### Scenario: Conversion from quote to credit sale
- **WHEN** the body includes both `quoteId: Q` and a `paymentMethod` whose `isCredit=true`, and the caller has `sales:create_credit`
- **THEN** the system applies BOTH the quote conversion AND the credit flow: the sale has `quoteId=Q`, `isCredit=true` (derived), `paidAmount=0`, `paymentStatus='pending'`; `customer.currentBalance += total`; the quote is marked converted

#### Scenario: Invalid quoteId (already converted)
- **WHEN** the body includes `quoteId: Q` where `Q` has `status='converted'`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 `{"error": "Quote cannot be linked to a new sale (status=converted)", "reason": "wrong_status"}` and the transaction does not commit

#### Scenario: Invalid quoteId (draft)
- **WHEN** the body includes `quoteId: Q` where `Q` has `status='draft'`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 `{"error": "Quote cannot be linked to a new sale (status=draft)", "reason": "wrong_status"}`

#### Scenario: Quote branch mismatch
- **WHEN** the body has `branchId: B1` but `quoteId: Q` where `Q.branchId = B2`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 and the transaction does not commit

#### Scenario: Quote customer mismatch
- **WHEN** the body has `customerId: C1` but `quoteId: Q` where `Q.customerId = C2`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400

#### Scenario: Selling product with no inventory record
- **WHEN** the body includes a `productId` that has no `branch_inventory` row for the target branch
- **THEN** the system creates the row with `quantity = -item.quantity` and returns HTTP 201

#### Scenario: Selling product with stock 0
- **WHEN** the current `branch_inventory.quantity = 0` and the item `quantity = 5`
- **THEN** the system updates the row to `quantity = -5` and returns HTTP 201

#### Scenario: Selling more than available (still allowed)
- **WHEN** the current `branch_inventory.quantity = 3` and the item `quantity = 10`
- **THEN** the system updates the row to `quantity = -7` and returns HTTP 201

#### Scenario: Branch scoping violation
- **WHEN** an `operator` with `x-user-branch-id: B1` posts a body with `branchId: B2`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403 `{"error": "Forbidden", "required": "branches:access_all"}`

#### Scenario: Inactive customer
- **WHEN** the body's `customerId` references a customer with `isActive=false`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 `{"error": "Customer is inactive"}` and the transaction does not commit

#### Scenario: Mismatched productPrice
- **WHEN** an item has `productId: A` but `productPriceId: P` where `P.product_id !== A`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 `{"error": "Product price does not belong to product"}` and the transaction does not commit

#### Scenario: Empty items
- **WHEN** the body has `items: []`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 `{"error": "Sale must include at least one item"}`

#### Scenario: Inactive folio
- **WHEN** the body's `folioId` references a folio with `isActive=false`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400

#### Scenario: Forbidden without sales:create
- **WHEN** a caller without `sales:create` calls the endpoint
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403 `{"error": "Forbidden", "required": "sales:create"}`

#### Scenario: Sale creation crossing reorder point triggers admin notification
- **WHEN** a sale item's decrement leaves `branch_inventory.quantity < reorder_point` for that (branch, product), and no notification for that pair was sent in the last 24h
- **THEN** the system still returns HTTP 201 as normal, AND — per `admin-notifications-api` — an email is sent to the configured admin address and `lastLowStockNotifiedAt` is updated; a failure to send this email does NOT affect the HTTP 201 response

#### Scenario: Dosification sale decrements a fraction of base stock
- **WHEN** the body has one item with `dosificationId` referencing a dosification with `numParts=4` and `quantity=3`, for a product whose default price is `100` and whose `branch_inventory.quantity = 10`, and no `pricing_settings` row exists yet (default 5% surcharge applies)
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 201 with `unitPrice = (100/4)*1.05 = 26.25` on that line; `branch_inventory.quantity` becomes `10 - (3/4) = 9.25`

#### Scenario: Dosification without default price rejected
- **WHEN** the body has an item with `dosificationId` referencing a dosification whose product has no default `ProductPrice`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 `{"error": "Dosification requires a default price"}` and the transaction does not commit

#### Scenario: Dosification/productPrice mutual exclusivity
- **WHEN** an item includes both `productPriceId` and `dosificationId`, or neither
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400

#### Scenario: Dosification not belonging to product
- **WHEN** an item has `productId: A` but `dosificationId: D` where `D.product_id !== A`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 and the transaction does not commit

#### Scenario: Inactive dosification rejected
- **WHEN** an item's `dosificationId` references a dosification with `isActive=false`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400

### Requirement: Cancel sale
The system SHALL expose `POST /api/v1/admin/sales/:id/cancel`. Requires `sales:cancel`. Body MAY include `reason: string | null` (max 500 chars). Branch scoping applies (callers without `branches:access_all` can only cancel sales in their assigned branch).

Behavior (inside a Prisma transaction):

- If `sale.status === 'cancelled'`: the operation is idempotent — returns HTTP 200 with the unchanged `SaleDetailDto` and the original `cancelledAt`/`cancellationReason`.
- If `sale.status === 'completed'` or `'edited'`:
  1. Load `sale.paymentMethod.isCredit` (via JOIN/include) so the credit-aware logic is consistent within the transaction.
  2. **Pre-check active payments**: if there is at least one `CustomerPayment` with `status='completed'` linked to this sale → HTTP 409 `{"error":"SaleHasActivePayments","paymentIds":["<id1>","<id2>",...]}`. The transaction does NOT commit. The operator MUST cancel each listed payment first. (In practice only credit sales can have active payments; the check applies unconditionally to all sales.)
  3. For each item, restore stock using the base-unit amount (`quantity / numPartsSnapshot` when the line has a dosification, `quantity` otherwise — see "Sale aggregate model"): `UPDATE branch_inventory SET quantity = quantity + ${amount}, updated_at = NOW() WHERE branch_id = ? AND product_id = ?`.
  4. If `paymentMethod.isCredit === true`: `UPDATE customers SET current_balance = current_balance - (sale.total - sale.paidAmount) WHERE id = sale.customerId`. (Since active payments are required to be already cancelled, `paidAmount` reflects only cancelled payments which don't affect balance — so this subtracts the original outstanding.)
  5. `UPDATE sales SET status='cancelled', cancelled_at=NOW(), cancellation_reason=?`.
- **After the transaction commits**, the system SHALL trigger the "Notify admin on sale cancellation" behavior per `admin-notifications-api` (best-effort, never blocks or fails this endpoint, never runs inside the Prisma transaction above).

The folio is NOT reusable — the folio number stays consumed. `paidAmount`, `paymentStatus`, `paymentMethodId` are preserved (frozen at the moment of cancellation; not reset).

**Interaction with returns**: cancelling a sale that has one or more `completed` returns DOES NOT cancel those returns and DOES NOT double-restore stock. The cancellation restores ONLY the stock matching the CURRENT `sale_items.quantity` (the original sold quantity, converted to base units per dosification when applicable). Returns continue to exist as standalone records; the operator who wants a fully clean state can cancel each return separately (which decrements stock back) BEFORE cancelling the sale. **Recommended order documented**: cancel returns first, then cancel the sale. The system does NOT enforce this order in v1 — if the sale is cancelled while completed returns exist, the resulting stock will be inflated relative to the post-return state by exactly the returned amount (the returns previously incremented stock; the cancel sale now also increments stock by the full sold quantity). Operators are expected to reconcile manually until a future change introduces a guard.

#### Scenario: Cancel completed cash sale
- **WHEN** an authorized caller cancels a `completed` sale whose `paymentMethod.isCredit=false` and items totalling X units
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 200, the sale `status` becomes `cancelled`, and `branch_inventory.quantity` for each item is incremented by the respective quantity
- **AND** `customer.currentBalance` is NOT modified

#### Scenario: Cancel credit sale with no payments
- **WHEN** a `completed` sale has `paymentMethod.isCredit=true`, `total=1000`, `paidAmount=0`, and no `CustomerPayment` rows
- **THEN** the cancellation proceeds: stock restored, `customer.currentBalance -= 1000`, `sale.status='cancelled'`

#### Scenario: Cancel credit sale with active payments rejected
- **WHEN** a `completed` sale has `paymentMethod.isCredit=true` and 2 `CustomerPayment` rows with `status='completed'`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 409 `{"error":"SaleHasActivePayments","paymentIds":[...]}` and nothing is persisted

#### Scenario: Cancel credit sale with only cancelled payments
- **WHEN** a `completed` sale has `paymentMethod.isCredit=true`, two `CustomerPayment` rows both `status='cancelled'`, `paidAmount=0`
- **THEN** the cancellation proceeds normally (the cancelled payments do not block)

#### Scenario: Cancel idempotent
- **WHEN** the same sale is cancelled twice
- **THEN** the second call returns HTTP 200 with no further side effects; `cancelled_at` and `cancellation_reason` remain from the first call

#### Scenario: Cancel edited sale restores edited items
- **WHEN** a sale was previously edited (status `edited`) and is now cancelled
- **THEN** the system restores stock based on the items currently in `sale_items` (the post-edit version) and sets `status='cancelled'`

#### Scenario: Cancel sale with returns (inflation risk documented)
- **WHEN** a `completed` sale had 10 units of product P sold, a `completed` return was registered for 4 units (stock incremented by 4), and the sale is then cancelled
- **THEN** the sale cancellation increments stock by the full 10 sold units; net effect on inventory is `+14` from a pre-sale-pre-return baseline. The two `Return` rows are unaffected. The operator is expected to reconcile (typically by cancelling the return first; v1 does not enforce the order — see design.md Risks).

#### Scenario: Out-of-branch cancellation
- **WHEN** an `operator` in branch B1 tries to cancel a sale whose `branchId = B2` and the operator lacks `branches:access_all`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403

#### Scenario: Sale not found
- **WHEN** the `:id` does not match any sale
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404

#### Scenario: Folio stays consumed
- **WHEN** a sale with `folio_number = 1024` is cancelled
- **THEN** the next emitted sale on the same folio takes `folio_number = 1025`, not `1024`

#### Scenario: Cancel sale with dosification line restores fractional stock
- **WHEN** a `completed` sale has one line with `numPartsSnapshot=4`, `quantity=3` (i.e. `0.75` base units decremented at emission), and the sale is cancelled
- **THEN** `branch_inventory.quantity` is incremented by `0.75` (not by `3`)

#### Scenario: Cancellation triggers admin notification after commit
- **WHEN** a `completed` sale with `folioCode="TK-000042"`, `total=1500` is cancelled with `reason="Cliente cambió de opinión"`
- **THEN** after the cancellation commits, the system attempts to email `ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` with the folio, total, reason, branch, and cashier; if this email send fails, the sale remains `cancelled` and the endpoint still returns HTTP 200

---

### Requirement: Edit completed sale (headquarters only)
The system SHALL expose `PATCH /api/v1/admin/sales/:id`. Requires `sales:edit_completed`. The body MUST include a complete `items: SaleItemInput[]` (the new version of the lines; min 1, same shape as "Create sale" — each item is either `productPriceId`-based or `dosificationId`-based). Optional: `customerId`, `paymentMethodId`, `notes`. The body MUST NOT change `folioId`, `folioNumber`, or `branchId`.

**Headquarters check (combined gate)**: before invoking the use case, the controller SHALL evaluate:

```
if (NOT user has 'branches:access_all') AND
   (x-user-branch-id is empty OR
    headquarters branch does not exist OR
    x-user-branch-id !== headquarters.id)
→ HTTP 403 {"error": "Sales can only be edited from the headquarters branch"}
```

That is: a caller with `branches:access_all` (admin) MAY edit from any branch; a caller without it MUST be assigned to the branch flagged `is_headquarters = TRUE`. Combined with the existing `sales:edit_completed` requirement, only an admin or a specially-granted user physically at HQ can edit.

Behavior (inside a Prisma transaction):

- If `sale.status === 'cancelled'` → HTTP 409 `{"error": "Cancelled sales cannot be edited"}`.
- **If the sale has one or more `CustomerPayment` rows with `status='completed'`** → HTTP 409 `{"error":"SaleHasActivePayments","paymentIds":[...]}`. The operator MUST cancel each listed payment first.
- Load the OLD `paymentMethod.isCredit` (from the current sale, before any change) AND the NEW `paymentMethod.isCredit` (if `paymentMethodId` changes in the body). Both flags govern the `currentBalance` delta below.
- Restore stock for each existing item using the base-unit amount (`quantity / numPartsSnapshot` when the persisted line has a dosification, `quantity` otherwise): `UPDATE branch_inventory SET quantity = quantity + ${oldAmount} WHERE branch_id = ? AND product_id = ?`.
- Delete all rows from `sale_items` for this `saleId`.
- Re-run the validation + snapshot + decrement + insert flow from "Create sale" using the new `items[]` (including the `productPriceId`/`dosificationId` resolution and the base-unit decrement for dosification lines).
- Recompute totals.
- Recompute `paidAmount` and `paymentStatus` according to the NEW `paymentMethod.isCredit`:
  - NEW `isCredit=false`: `paidAmount = newTotal`, `paymentStatus = 'paid'`.
  - NEW `isCredit=true`: `paidAmount = 0`, `paymentStatus = 'pending'`.
- Update `customer.currentBalance` by `(- oldOutstanding + newOutstanding)` where:
  - `oldOutstanding = (oldIsCredit ? oldTotal - oldPaidAmount : 0)`.
  - `newOutstanding = (newIsCredit ? newTotal : 0)`.
- If the NEW `paymentMethod.isCredit=true`, ALSO validate the credit limit (`customer.currentBalance + newOutstanding <= customer.creditLimit`) and the `sales:create_credit` permission of the caller; failure → HTTP 409/403 respectively.
- `UPDATE sales SET subtotal=?, tax_total=?, total=?, status='edited', edited_at=NOW(), customer_id=?, payment_method_id=?, notes=?, paid_amount=?, payment_status=?`. `folio_id`/`folio_number`/`folio_code`/`branch_id` are NOT changed.

#### Scenario: Admin edits ticket from any branch
- **WHEN** an `admin` (has `branches:access_all` and `sales:edit_completed`) PATCHes a completed cash sale (no payments) with a new items array
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 200 with the recalculated `SaleDetailDto` and `status='edited'`

#### Scenario: Edit sale with active payments rejected
- **WHEN** the target sale has at least one `CustomerPayment` with `status='completed'`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 409 `{"error":"SaleHasActivePayments","paymentIds":[...]}` and nothing is persisted

#### Scenario: Edit credit sale recomputes balance
- **WHEN** a credit sale with `total=1000`, `paidAmount=0` (no active payments) is edited to a new `total=1200`, keeping the same credit `paymentMethodId`
- **THEN** `customer.currentBalance -= 1000` and `customer.currentBalance += 1200` net `+200`; the sale has `paidAmount=0`, `paymentStatus='pending'`

#### Scenario: Edit cash sale to credit
- **WHEN** a cash sale with `paymentMethod.isCredit=false`, `total=500` is edited to a new `paymentMethodId` whose `isCredit=true`, and the caller has `sales:create_credit`
- **THEN** the sale becomes credit: `paidAmount=0`, `paymentStatus='pending'`; `customer.currentBalance += newTotal` (since `oldOutstanding=0` because original was cash)

#### Scenario: Edit credit sale to cash
- **WHEN** a credit sale with `paymentMethod.isCredit=true`, `total=1000`, `paidAmount=0`, no active payments, is edited to a new `paymentMethodId` whose `isCredit=false`
- **THEN** the sale becomes cash: `paidAmount=newTotal`, `paymentStatus='paid'`; `customer.currentBalance -= 1000` (the original outstanding)

#### Scenario: Operator at HQ without sales:edit_completed
- **WHEN** an `operator` with `x-user-branch-id = HQ_id` (no `sales:edit_completed`) PATCHes a sale
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403 `{"error": "Forbidden", "required": "sales:edit_completed"}`

#### Scenario: User with sales:edit_completed but not at HQ
- **WHEN** a user with `sales:edit_completed` but `x-user-branch-id != HQ_id` and without `branches:access_all` PATCHes a sale
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403 `{"error": "Sales can only be edited from the headquarters branch"}`

#### Scenario: Edit cancelled sale
- **WHEN** the target sale has `status='cancelled'`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 409 `{"error": "Cancelled sales cannot be edited"}` and does not commit

#### Scenario: Edit zeroes out items
- **WHEN** the body has `items: []`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 `{"error": "Sale must include at least one item"}` and does not commit

#### Scenario: Folio invariants preserved
- **WHEN** the body includes `folioId` or `folioNumber`
- **THEN** the system silently ignores those fields and persists the original folio data

#### Scenario: Branch invariant preserved
- **WHEN** the body includes `branchId` different from the sale's current `branch_id`
- **THEN** the system silently ignores it and persists the original `branch_id`

#### Scenario: Stock fully recomputed
- **WHEN** the original items consumed 5 units of product A and 0 of B, and the new items consume 0 of A and 3 of B
- **THEN** after the edit, `branch_inventory.quantity` for A is restored by 5 and for B is decremented by 3 (allowed to go negative)

#### Scenario: Edit replaces a dosification line with a price line
- **WHEN** the original line had `numPartsSnapshot=4`, `quantity=3` (0.75 base units decremented), and the new items array replaces it with a normal price-based line of `quantity=2` for the same product
- **THEN** stock is restored by `0.75` (old dosification line) and then decremented by `2` (new price line) — net `-1.25` from the pre-edit baseline

#### Scenario: Edit's new-item decrement triggers admin notification
- **WHEN** the "decrement" half of the re-run "Create sale" flow (step re-run above) leaves `branch_inventory.quantity < reorder_point` for the new items, per the same debounce rule as "Create sale"
- **THEN** the low-stock notification per `admin-notifications-api` fires the same way it would for a direct sale creation — the edit flow does not special-case this

---

### Requirement: SaleTotalsCalculator (domain service)
The system SHALL provide a pure domain service `SaleTotalsCalculator` in `src/modules/pos/domain/services/SaleTotalsCalculator.ts` with a static method:

```
computeTotals(lines: SaleLineInput[]): SaleTotalsResult
```

`SaleLineInput`: `{ quantity, unitPrice, discountPct?, ivaRate?, iepsRate? }` — all decimals; `discountPct` defaults to `0` when absent; `ivaRate`/`iepsRate` default to `0` when `null`/absent.

`SaleTotalsResult`: `{ lines: SaleLineTotals[], subtotal, taxTotal, total }`. Each `SaleLineTotals`: `{ lineSubtotal, lineIva, lineIeps, lineTax, lineTotal }`.

`unitPrice` represents the FINAL price the customer pays for that unit — taxes are already included in it. The system SHALL extract (not add) the tax from that price using the standard tax-inclusive-price formula:

```
lineGross    = round(quantity * unitPrice * (1 - discountPct / 100), 4)
divisor      = 1 + ivaRate + iepsRate
lineSubtotal = round(lineGross / divisor, 4)
lineIva      = round(lineSubtotal * ivaRate, 4)
lineIeps     = round(lineSubtotal * iepsRate, 4)
lineTax      = lineIva + lineIeps
lineTotal    = lineGross
```

`lineTotal` (what the customer pays) is unaffected by this change — only the internal subtotal/IVA/IEPS breakdown changes. When `ivaRate = iepsRate = 0`, `divisor = 1` and the formula degenerates to the previous behavior (`lineSubtotal = lineGross = lineTotal`).

Header totals are the sum across lines for `lineSubtotal`, `lineTax`, `lineTotal` respectively (mapped to `subtotal`, `taxTotal`, `total`). Rounding uses banker's rounding (half-to-even) at 4 decimal places. The service SHALL throw if `quantity <= 0`, `unitPrice < 0`, `discountPct < 0 || discountPct > 100`, `ivaRate < 0 || ivaRate > 1`, or `iepsRate < 0 || iepsRate > 1`. No I/O dependencies (no Prisma, no fetch).

#### Scenario: Simple line
- **WHEN** `computeTotals([{ quantity: 2, unitPrice: 100, ivaRate: 0.16 }])` is invoked
- **THEN** the result has `lineSubtotal = 172.4138`, `lineIva = 27.5862`, `lineTax = 27.5862`, `lineTotal = 200`, `subtotal = 172.4138`, `taxTotal = 27.5862`, `total = 200`

#### Scenario: With discount
- **WHEN** `computeTotals([{ quantity: 1, unitPrice: 100, discountPct: 10 }])` is invoked
- **THEN** `lineSubtotal = 90`, `lineTotal = 90` (no tax rates, formula degenerates to gross = subtotal)

#### Scenario: With IVA and IEPS
- **WHEN** `computeTotals([{ quantity: 1, unitPrice: 100, ivaRate: 0.16, iepsRate: 0.08 }])` is invoked
- **THEN** `lineSubtotal = 80.6452`, `lineIva = 12.9032`, `lineIeps = 6.4516`, `lineTax = 19.3548`, `lineTotal = 100` — both taxes are extracted simultaneously from the same base (`divisor = 1.24`), not in cascade

#### Scenario: Null rates treated as zero
- **WHEN** `computeTotals([{ quantity: 1, unitPrice: 100, ivaRate: null, iepsRate: null }])` is invoked
- **THEN** `lineTax = 0`, `lineSubtotal = 100`, `lineTotal = 100`

#### Scenario: Multi-line aggregation
- **WHEN** `computeTotals([{quantity:1,unitPrice:100,ivaRate:0.16}, {quantity:2,unitPrice:50}])` is invoked
- **THEN** `subtotal = 186.2069`, `taxTotal = 13.7931`, `total = 200`

#### Scenario: Domain purity
- **WHEN** unit tests run against the calculator
- **THEN** no Prisma, no fetch, no environment access is required

#### Scenario: Invalid input rejected
- **WHEN** `computeTotals([{ quantity: 0, unitPrice: 100 }])` is invoked
- **THEN** the method throws a validation error

### Requirement: Branch scoping pattern for sale endpoints
Every route handler in `pos-api` that operates on a sale or on a branch-specific listing SHALL enforce the following scoping pattern using `x-user-branch-id` (from middleware) and `branches:access_all` (via `AuthorizationService.userCan`):

```
const bypass = await authz.userCan(userId, "branches:access_all");
if (!bypass) {
  const userBranch = req.headers.get("x-user-branch-id") ?? "";
  if (userBranch === "" || resourceBranchId !== userBranch) {
    return 403 { error: "Forbidden", required: "branches:access_all" };
  }
}
```

`resourceBranchId` is either: (a) the `branchId` in the request body/query for creates and listings, or (b) the `branchId` joined from the persisted sale for reads/updates/cancels/edits. Reads MUST resolve the sale's `branchId` BEFORE applying the check (so a 403 is not used as an existence oracle; if the sale does not exist, return 404 first).

#### Scenario: Resource leak prevented
- **WHEN** an unauthorized user requests `GET /api/v1/admin/sales/<id-of-sale-in-other-branch>`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403 (not 200, not 404) only if the sale exists; if it does not exist, returns HTTP 404 (existence is revealed only to anyone with permission to look)

#### Scenario: Listing default
- **WHEN** an `operator` with `branchId=B1` (no bypass) calls `GET /api/v1/admin/sales` without `?branchId=`
- **THEN** the listing is implicitly scoped to `B1`

#### Scenario: Listing without assigned branch
- **WHEN** a user without `branches:access_all` and without a `branchId` calls `GET /api/v1/admin/sales` without `?branchId=`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403

---

### Requirement: POS product catalog does NOT expose product imageUrl
The POS lookup endpoint(s) used to populate the POS product catalog (e.g., `searchProducts` consumed by `PosLookupService`) SHALL NOT expose the `imageUrl` field of products. The DTO returned to the POS frontend MUST NOT include `imageUrl`. The `SaleItem` snapshot (`product_code_snapshot`, `product_name_snapshot`, `price_name_snapshot`, etc.) MUST NOT store any image reference. This preserves payload size and rendering latency on the POS catalog.

#### Scenario: searchProducts response excludes imageUrl
- **WHEN** the POS frontend invokes the product search endpoint
- **THEN** each item in the response MUST NOT contain an `imageUrl` field

#### Scenario: SaleItem snapshot excludes image
- **WHEN** a sale is created
- **THEN** the persisted `sale_items` rows MUST NOT contain any image-related column

#### Scenario: Quote and Return snapshots also exclude image
- **WHEN** a quote item or return item is created
- **THEN** the persisted snapshot MUST NOT contain any image-related column

---

### Requirement: Folio scope must be POS for sales

`CreateSaleUseCase` SHALL validar, después de cargar el `Folio` desde el `folioId` recibido, que `folio.scope === 'POS'`. Si el scope no coincide, el use case SHALL lanzar `FolioScopeMismatchError(expected='POS', actual=<folio.scope>)` que el controller mapea a HTTP 400 `{"error":"FolioScopeMismatch","expected":"POS","actual":"<scope>"}`. La validación SHALL ocurrir en el mismo paso que `folio.isActive`, antes de cualquier mutación de inventario o asignación de folio. `EditCompletedSaleUseCase` no admite cambios de `folioId` (folio inmutable en edit), por lo que NO requiere chequeo adicional: el folio original ya fue validado contra `scope='POS'` en la creación.

#### Scenario: Crear venta con folio POS válido

- **WHEN** un usuario con `sales:create` envía `POST /api/v1/admin/sales` con `folioId` apuntando a un folio cuyo `scope='POS'` (e.g. `TK`, `TC`)
- **THEN** el sistema procede con la emisión normal y retorna HTTP 201

#### Scenario: Crear venta con folio OPERATIONS rechazada

- **WHEN** la request usa `folioId` apuntando a un folio cuyo `scope='OPERATIONS'` (e.g. `RB`)
- **THEN** el sistema retorna HTTP 400 `{"error":"FolioScopeMismatch","expected":"POS","actual":"OPERATIONS"}` SIN tocar inventario ni `current_number` del folio

#### Scenario: Crear venta con folio INVENTORY rechazada

- **WHEN** la request usa `folioId` apuntando a un folio cuyo `scope='INVENTORY'` (e.g. `TS`)
- **THEN** el sistema retorna HTTP 400 `{"error":"FolioScopeMismatch","expected":"POS","actual":"INVENTORY"}`

#### Scenario: Scope check ocurre antes de allocate folio

- **WHEN** la request usa un folio con scope incorrecto pero `is_active=true` y `current_number=42`
- **THEN** tras el 400, `current_number` sigue en 42 (no se incrementa por el intento fallido)

---

### Requirement: SaleRepository.createCompletedFromQuote (conversion bridge)
The system SHALL extend `SaleRepository` with a method `createCompletedFromQuote(input, tx)` that:

- Accepts an open Prisma transaction handle `tx` (so the caller — typically `ConvertQuoteToSaleUseCase` — orchestrates the outer transaction that also updates the quote).
- Accepts an input including `branchId`, `customerId`, `paymentMethodId`, `folioId`, `cashierId`, `notes`, `quoteId`, and a pre-snapshotted `items: SaleItemSnapshotInput[]` (each item carries `productId`, `productPriceId`, `quantity`, `productCodeSnapshot`, `productNameSnapshot`, `priceNameSnapshot`, `unitPrice`, `discountPct`, `ivaRate`, `iepsRate` — values copied from the quote's `quote_items`, NOT re-resolved from the catalog).
- Reuses the same SQL plan as `createCompleted`: atomic folio increment via `UPDATE folios ... RETURNING`, per-item `UPDATE branch_inventory ... SET quantity = quantity - qty WHERE branch_id = ? AND product_id = ?` falling back to `INSERT branch_inventory (..., -qty)` when no row exists, `INSERT sales (..., quote_id=<quoteId>)`, `INSERT sale_items`.
- Computes totals from the snapshotted unit prices using `SaleTotalsCalculator` (since the snapshots are authoritative for cotization-derived sales).
- Returns the same `SaleDetailDto` shape as `createCompleted`.

The original `createCompleted` SHALL remain unchanged and continues to be used by `POST /api/v1/admin/sales` for direct sale emission.

#### Scenario: Conversion preserves snapshot prices
- **WHEN** `createCompletedFromQuote` is invoked with snapshot `unitPrice: 12.50`, and the current catalog price for that `productPriceId` is `13.00`
- **THEN** the resulting `sale_item.unit_price = 12.50` (the snapshot wins; the conversion does NOT re-resolve from the catalog)

#### Scenario: Conversion uses fiscal folio
- **WHEN** `createCompletedFromQuote` is invoked with `folioId = F_fiscal`
- **THEN** `F_fiscal.current_number` is incremented by 1 and the resulting `sale.folioId = F_fiscal`; the quote's folio (which is a different folio entirely) is NOT touched

#### Scenario: Conversion decrements inventory
- **WHEN** `createCompletedFromQuote` is invoked for an item `{ productId: P, quantity: 5 }` and the current `branch_inventory.quantity` for (branch, P) is `10`
- **THEN** after the call, `branch_inventory.quantity` is `5`

#### Scenario: Conversion allows negative stock
- **WHEN** `createCompletedFromQuote` is invoked for an item with `quantity = 30` and current inventory is `0`
- **THEN** the resulting inventory is `-30` (no rejection, same rule as direct POS sales)

### Requirement: Send sale ticket by email
The system SHALL expose `POST /api/v1/admin/sales/:id/send-ticket-email`. Requires `sales:read` (same permission as viewing the sale; no new permission introduced — sending a copy of an already-visible ticket is not a higher-privilege action). Enforces the same branch scope as `GET /sales/:id` (`enforceBranchScope`, loading the sale first). Optional body: `{ email?: string }` — when omitted, the recipient is `sale.customer.email` (via the sale's linked customer, which is nullable for walk-in/"público general" sales).

Behavior:

1. Load the sale via the same lookup used by `GET /sales/:id` (with items); enforce branch scope; not found → HTTP 404.
2. Resolve the recipient: `body.email` if present and non-empty (validated as a well-formed email via Zod `.email()`, else HTTP 400), otherwise `sale.customer?.email`. If both are absent/null → HTTP 400 `{"error": "Customer has no email and no override provided"}`.
3. Compose a single HTML email summarizing the ticket (folio, date, items, subtotal, IVA, IEPS, total, payment method) — no PDF/XML attachment (unlike `billing-api`'s invoice email, there is no generated file to attach; the ticket is a live-rendered summary).
4. Send the email to the resolved recipient via `MailerPort`. This send is SYNCHRONOUS — a failure (SMTP unreachable, auth failure, etc.) SHALL propagate to the caller as HTTP 502 `{"error": "Failed to send ticket email"}`. Nothing about the sale record is mutated by this endpoint either way.

Returns HTTP 200 `{"sentTo": "<resolved-email>"}` on success.

#### Scenario: Successful send to customer's email
- **WHEN** an authorized caller POSTs with no body for a sale whose linked `customer.email = "cliente@ejemplo.com"`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 200 `{"sentTo": "cliente@ejemplo.com"}` and a summary email was sent to that address

#### Scenario: Override recipient
- **WHEN** the body is `{ "email": "otra@direccion.com" }`
- **THEN** the email is sent to `otra@direccion.com` regardless of `customer.email`

#### Scenario: Walk-in sale with no customer requires an override
- **WHEN** the sale has `customerId: null` (público general) and the body omits `email`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 `{"error": "Customer has no email and no override provided"}` and no send is attempted

#### Scenario: Customer exists but has no email on file
- **WHEN** the sale's linked `customer.email` is `null` and the body omits `email`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 `{"error": "Customer has no email and no override provided"}`

#### Scenario: Malformed override email
- **WHEN** the body is `{ "email": "not-an-email" }`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 with a Zod validation error, no send is attempted

#### Scenario: SMTP failure propagates to caller
- **WHEN** the SMTP server is unreachable or rejects authentication
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 502 `{"error": "Failed to send ticket email"}`

#### Scenario: Forbidden without sales:read
- **WHEN** a caller without `sales:read` calls the endpoint
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403 `{"error": "Forbidden", "required": "sales:read"}`

#### Scenario: Branch scoping violation
- **WHEN** a caller without `branches:access_all` requests a sale belonging to a different branch than `x-user-branch-id`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 403 `{"error": "Forbidden", "required": "branches:access_all"}`

#### Scenario: Sale not found
- **WHEN** `:id` does not reference an existing sale
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404
